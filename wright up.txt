Project Name :Docerizing Angular Application
Tools used:
		Docker:creating container
		aws:ec2 instance
		visual studio code.

Requirements:
	As a MEAN Stack Developer,
 	you have to deploy an Angular application on Docker container on an EC2 instance.


steps we have done :

1)First we build the angular application by using the command ng build --prod .

2)Ater building it generates the dist file ,we need to copy that files for the future use.

3)we need to create a docker file in our angular application .

4)we build images using the command docker built -p 80:80 image_name.

5)we need to create the container also .docker run -d -p 90:90 --name container1 appname

6)After that we created the ec2 instance and we have copied the dist files to the virtual machine ,
using the ipv4 address we are able to access the our angular application.

7)http://35.154.50.145/#/ open this link to find my angular application.
